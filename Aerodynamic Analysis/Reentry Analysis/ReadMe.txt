This project calculates the temperatures experienced by a spacecraft reentering the atmosphere from orbit, with known Mach numbers
throughout its trajectory. It calculates temperatures with a calorically perfect gas model as well as a thermally perfect gas 
model in order to explore the differences. Reentry_Analysis.m is the master script and can be run as long as the rest of the 
files are in the same folder.
