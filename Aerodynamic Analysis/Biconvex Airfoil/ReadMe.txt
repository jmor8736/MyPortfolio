This is a test of three tools created to estimate aerodynamic forces on a biconvex airfoil in a M = 2.13 freestream. The three methods used in the tools are Buseman's method, a Linear Potential Theory based method, and a Shock Wave and Expansion Theory based method. All functions have been compiled into a single master script for easy use.
