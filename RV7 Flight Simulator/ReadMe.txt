This folder contains two integrators for simulating the state of a Van's RV-7 aircraft in the climb/descent and cruise portions of flight. These are two degrees of freedom, state based simulations meant to estimate flight time and fuel consumption. A third script file is included, which calls on the state integrators to get overall flight profile, fuel consumption, and time of flight for a test flight through a series of known waypoint, including a touch and go midway through. The master script is called flight_test.m and will run as long as all files are in the same folder as it, including aquisicao.mat (which contains engine deck information).
*Please note that the engine deck functions, including engine_O360.m and engine_propeller.m were written by Dr. Iscold of the Cal Poly Aerospace Engineering departement and are documented in Portuguese.
