This is a mass properties estimation tool designed to aid in the design process of my aircraft design class. It is based off of statistical methods developed by Daniel P. Raymer and adjusted to fit our specific design problem better. We are designing an aircraft to circumnavigate the world, non-refueled, non-stop. This requires a high L/D and EWF, meaning we are designing planes with high aspect ratios and need to test the effect of fuel booms on the wings. Raymer's method was developed for GA aircraft with much lower aspect ratios and wingspans. The wing weight portion of this code has correction factors developed from first principles of weight distribution over the wingspan to take the reduction of moment loading at the wing root that results from this into account. This code also estimates the center of gravity of the candidate design so designers can ensure they have a feasible design.
