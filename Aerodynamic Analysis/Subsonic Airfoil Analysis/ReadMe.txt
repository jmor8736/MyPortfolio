This project tests a lumped vortex panel method and a thin airfoil theory based method by calculating the aerodynamic forces and 
coefficients experienced by a NACA 4415 airfoil and compares results to those generated by xfoil. A grid convergence analysis is 
performed in order to determine the proper number of panels to include. To run this analysis, one must simply ensure that all
files (including NACA4415.txt) are in the same folder as Airfoil_Analysis.m and then run Airfoil_Analysis.m.
